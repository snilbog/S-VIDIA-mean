        		<p>Server software is installed on every SVIDIA DVR. The server software is the center of our DVRs, and carries out many of the core features that you wonâ€™t find with any other system. The software analyzes, compresses, streams, and records relevant video footage. Because of the seamless functionality of the server software, users can stream live and recorded video to connected clients, control I/O devices, and record to the database simultaneously with no interruptions. Below are some of the highlighted benefits  of the server software:</p><hr>
          
          <div class="col-sm-6">
        		<h4>Hybrid Capability</h4>
        			<p>S&#x2011;VIDIA server software renders the best possible performance for any camera, including analog, IP and Megapixel.</p><br>
        	
        		<h4>Ease of Use</h4>
        			<p>There is no server software maintenance required.  Authorized users can also access the software and perform analytic functions like motion search from anywhere in the world.</p><br>
        		
      			<h4>No Loss of Detail, No Wasted Space</h4>
      				<p>The server software receives uncompressed video from the hardware for processing. The raw video is analyzed before it is compressed, for both noise (using NIP) and actual motion. This prior-to-compression analyses ensures whatever is important will be recorded and played back exactly as the camera sees it, and whatever is unimportant (noise) will never rob you of data storage space.</p><br>
      		</div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
      			<h4>Optimum Performance</h4>
      				<p>Not only does the software bring out the best performance in cameras, but it also self regulates for optimum software performance. Because S&#x2011;VIDIA systems allow up to 32 remote user connections to view live and recorded images simultaneously, it is imperative that each system manages resources effectively. The server software communicates between connected clients, allocating resources to the most vital tasks.</p><br>
      	
      			<h4>Secure Video Security</h4>
      				<p>The server software is equipped to store even the most sensitive data. All outgoing video transmissions are passed through 128 bit encryption. Also, S&#x2011;VIDIA decryption keys change intermittently, ensuring secure transmission of data at all times.</p>
