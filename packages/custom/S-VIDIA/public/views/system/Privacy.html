          <h4>Your privacy is important to us.</h4><br>
            S&#x2011;VIDIA is committed to protecting your privacy, but sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request.  This privacy statement explains data collection and use in those situations. This statement does not apply to S&#x2011;VIDIA products or services. Please read the complete S&#x2011;VIDIA.com privacy statement.

            Personal information collected by S&#x2011;VIDIA is typically restricted to e&#x2011;mail address, language, country, or location, but may include other information when needed. For instance, a transaction that involves payment will require us to request billing and/or shipping information, a telephone number, and a credit card number.  

            <h4>Use of your Personal Information</h4>
            <h5>We use your personal information for the following purposes:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>To deliver services, such as newsletters or events.</li>
              <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from S&#x2011;VIDIA, if you so request.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>

            <p>S&#x2011;VIDIA may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on S&#x2011;VIDIA or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of S&#x2011;VIDIA and its family of Web sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of S&#x2011;VIDIA employees, users of S&#x2011;VIDIA products or services, or members of the public.</p>

            <p>When you give us personal information, S&#x2011;VIDIA will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above.</p>

            <h5>Use of Cookies</h5>
            <p>When someone visits the site, a cookie may be placed on the customer's machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. One use of cookies is to assist in the collection of the site visitation statistics described above.</p>

            <h5>Enforcement of this Privacy Statement</h5>
            <p>If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact S&#x2011;VIDIA by e-mail. S&#x2011;VIDIA will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. For material changes to this statement, S&#x2011;VIDIA will notify you by placing prominent notice on the Web site.</p>
