      <h3>What is S-VIDIA?</h3>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
           <p class="Justy">S&#x2011;VIDIA is a security platform designed around a compression method intended for the security industry. The technology implemented by S&#x2011;VIDIA was created with one purpose: Recording the highest quality evidence possible, while consuming minimal resources. The core of S&#x2011;VIDIA&rsquo;s technology is the proprietary compression method, Flexible Delta Compression (FDC). This method outperforms the industry standards of H.264 and H.265 in bandwidth efficiency, picture quality, and evidence reliability.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4><b>Why is video compression important?</b>/h4>
              <p class="Justy">Because it determines the overall storage size and most importantly quality of the evidence. When a crime is committed, most people need a high quality picture of the criminal, not just video evidence of the event. Without costly investment in technology, traditional compression methods such as h.264 donâ€™t offer frame to frame image accuracy that people expect from security video evidence.

    <!-- <h3>The Core</h3>
        <p class="Justy">The core of S&#x2011;VIDIA&rsquo;s technology is the proprietary compression method, Flexible Delta Compression (FDC). This method outperforms the industry standards of H.264 and H.265 in bandwidth efficiency, picture quality, and evidence reliability. </p> -->
        <ul class="Justy">
          <li><b>FDC records only what is important and necessary: changes or movement.</b> Unmoving background is recorded separately from the moving foreground, as an image, allowing for outstanding clarity of the recorded movement. Conventional video security systems record hours of unnecessary background noise, and require lengthy searches to find an event. Because of FDC, S&#x2011;VIDIA users can run an automated search program for movement in a selected area and time, and let the computer compile the evidence.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>FDC compression retains frames as separate images, allowing for true frame by frame recording and playback.</b> This is important when pausing video for evidence retrieval. The system displays the exact image seen by the camera at any given moment. It is able to analyze real time raw video, because it spends less time processing each frame. H.264 and H.265 process video too slowly to produce detailed frames, resulting in lagging, skipping, and inadequate evidence.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>FDC does not use hardware compression, meaning no quality or resolution is lost before analog video is processed by analytics.</b> Analog and IP camera signals are analyzed prior to compression, allowing for the most accurate motion detection in the industry. FDC maximizes the performance of any type of camera used, from analog, to HD IP, to Ultra HD IP.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>FDC stores and plays back the exact image seen by the camera, in full quality.</b> Multi-media compression methods like H.264 and H.265 only store partial information about an image, and must reconstruct it from the key frame and the prediction frame. The image is then considered altered, and not 100% true to the original. Any alterations can keep recordings from qualifying as court admissible evidence. All frames processed with FDC are stored separately, watermarked, and encrypted, ensuring this will never happen to S-VIDIA clients.</li><br>
          
          <li><b>FDC decreases costs, and saves time.</b> S&#x2011;VIDIA DVRs use an average of 60% less recording space than conventional systems. The cost of an overall system deployment can be cut to the same degree. At the same time, video retention capabilities increase and evidence retrieval becomes instantaneous.</li>
